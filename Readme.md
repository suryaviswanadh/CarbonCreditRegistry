Carbon Credit Registry
Project Title
Carbon Credit Registry - Verified Carbon Credit Trading System
Project Description
The Carbon Credit Registry is a blockchain-based smart contract system built on the Aptos network that enables verified carbon credit trading. This decentralized platform allows organizations and individuals to register their verified carbon credits, set pricing, and facilitate secure peer-to-peer trading of carbon offsets. The system ensures transparency, traceability, and authenticity in carbon credit transactions, contributing to global climate action initiatives.
